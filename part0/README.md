## 📝 Exercises Overview

### 0.4 - New Note Diagram
This exercise involves creating a sequence diagram to describe what happens when a user creates a new note in the app. The diagram shows the interactions between the user, the client, and the server.

### 0.5 - Single Page App Diagram
In this exercise, I illustrate the sequence of events when a user navigates within a single-page application (SPA), emphasizing the concept of client-side routing and asynchronous requests.

### 0.6 - New Note in SPA Diagram
This exercise builds on the previous one, adding the details of how a user creates a new note within a single-page application. The diagram highlights the interactions between the user, the SPA client, and the server, demonstrating how data is sent and received.
